# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This is a full project that I completed using Machine Learning And Flask backend with HTML,CSS,JS for the frontend . This is a web application that predicts real-estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and features. The model is trained on a dataset of historical real estate transactions.I maily Used Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook for the development environment in ML. I hopes to deploy this project in the AWS cloud in the future.
